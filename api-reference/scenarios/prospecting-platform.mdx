title: Data Warehouse Integration

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Markix with your
data warehouse. You will learn how to write and schedule queries, set up
webhooks that notify when a scheduled query completes, and finally, how to
import query results into your data warehouse.

## Example Scenario

Imagine you're offering a prospecting platform where users can search for
potential business leads. Markix does the hard work of providing fresh, relevant
lead information, which you can then import into your data warehouse. Having
data on-premises minimizes dependencies on external services and improves
response times, crucial for platforms where speed and data freshness directly
impact user success and satisfaction.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to have the following:

- A Markix account
- Write-access to your data warehouse

<Steps>
    <Step title="Writing a Query">
        Start by writing a query in Markix to extract the specific data you need:

        1. **Create or Open an Existing Query:** Log into your Markix account and [navigato to Queries](https://app.markix.com/queries). Select an existing query or [create a new one](https://app.markix.com/queries/create).
        2. **Write Your Query:** Use the SQL editor to write your query. For instance, to simply get all the Webflow sites:

        ```sql
        -- Returns all Webflow sites
        SELECT * FROM rune_webflow

        -- Optionally include a limit to test the query first
        -- LIMIT 10
        ```

        3. **Test and Save Your Query:** Execute the query to ensure it returns the correct data, then save it.
    </Step>


    <Step title="Scheduling the Query">
        Automate your data extraction by scheduling your query:

        1. **Open the Schedule Modal:** In the Query Editor, click on the “Schedule” button for your saved query.
        2. **Set the Schedule:** Choose how often you want the query to run (e.g., hourly, daily).
        3. **Save the Schedule:** Confirm the details and save your schedule.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configuring a Webhook">
        Use a webhook to get real-time notifications when your query has new results:

        1. **Add a Webhook URL:** In the Schedule Modal, find the webhook section and enter the URL of your data warehouse API where data should be sent.
        2. **Configure Webhook Settings:** Specify any additional headers or data formats required by your data warehouse.
        3. **Activate the Webhook:** Save the configuration to start receiving data on your scheduled intervals.

        Next, ensure that your application is set up to receive webhooks and
        process the data sent by Markix.

        The notification webhook we care about looks like this:

        ```json
        {
            "created_at": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
            "type": "query.execution.updated",
            "data": {
                "object": {
                    "id": "a1b2c3d4",
                    "object": "query_execution",
                    "status": "completed",
                    "status_message": null,
                    "started_at": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
                    "ended_at": "2021-09-01T12:01:00Z",
                    "scheduled": true,
                    "diffed": false,
                    "created_at": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
                    "updated_at": "2021-09-01T12:01:00Z",
                    "result": {
                        "total": 100,
                        "data": [...]
                    }
                }
            },
            "object": "event"
        }
        ```

        Pay special attention to the `status` field in the webhook payload to
        confirm that the query execution has successfully completed. Also,
        if you only care about scheduled or manual executions, you can filter
        the webhooks by the `scheduled` field. The `diffed` field indicates
        whether a changeset was generated for the query results, which only
        contains additions and deletions since the last execution.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Receive a Webhook">
        

        
    </Step>

     <Step title="Receive a Webhook, and Request an Export">
        Once you receive a webhook notification, confirm that the query
        execution has successfully completed by checking the `status` field in
        the webhook payload.

        Next, request an export of the query results:

        Use the Export API Endpoint: Send a GET request to the export endpoint with your query ID:
        ```http
        GET /api/queries/12345/export
        Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
        ```
        Choose the Format: Specify the format you need, such as CSV or JSON, to match your data warehouse’s requirements.

    </Step>

     <Step title="Importing Data into Your Warehouse">
        Finally, import the data into your data warehouse:

        If your application is set up to receive webhooks, make sure to 
        
    </Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Markix with your data warehouse, automating data extraction and importation, and enhancing your data-driven decision-making.
