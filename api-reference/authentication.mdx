## Overview

Markix uses API keys to authenticate requests to the API. API keys can be
managed in your [account settings](). Each request to the API must include a
valid bearer token.

## Obtaining Your Bearer Token

1. **Log in to your Markix account.** Navigate to your account settings or the
   API section.
2. **Generate a new API token.** Follow the instructions to create a new token.
   This token will represent your API credentials.
3. **Keep your token secure.** Treat your token like a password. Do not share it
   and store it securely.

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your bearer token in the HTTP authorization header or as a query
parameter when making requests to the API. Here is an example of how to include
the authorization header in a request:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Header-based Authentication">
    Include the bearer token in the `Authorization` header of your request:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.markix.com/queries" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Query Parameter Authentication">
    Alternatively, you can include the token as a query parameter in the URL:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.markix.com/queries?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with authentication:

- Ensure the bearer token is correctly formatted and included in the
  authorization header.
- Verify that the token has not expired or been revoked.
- Check for any IP restrictions or additional security measures that might be
  blocking your requests.
- If you continue to experience issues, contact our support for assistance.
