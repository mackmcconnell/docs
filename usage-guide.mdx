Markix is accessible via API or a user-friendly web interface.

### API Reference
For API documentation please see our [API reference](https://docs.markix.com/api-reference/introduction).

### Markix Web Interface

[SCREENSHOT here]


The Markix UI includes a comprehensive suite of tools:
1. **Table Reference**: Access and manipulate data in tabular form.
2. **Query Editor**: Directly write SQL or utilize Runes to build queries.
3. **Results Section**: View and analyze the data fetched by your queries.

#### Export your query
You can export your query by clicking “Export” (5)

#### Make updates to your query and re-run:
Once you’ve run your query you can make iterations and continue to re-run. All prior results will be saved in the Executions tab (#4 in prior screenshot).

#### Be notified upon changes
Sign up for notifications when a new website/company drifts into your search criteria. This often means that website has added or removed a given software, an exciting time for a sales person working with a competing software to reach out to them! To do this click “Schedule” (6).
