### API Reference
For API documentation please see our [API reference](https://docs.markix.com/api-reference/introduction).

### Markix Web Interface
The Markix user interface has three important sectiosn:
1. **Table Reference**
2. **Query Editor**
3. **Results Section**
4. **Executions Tab**

In this screenshot weâ€™re simply searching the entire web to return all websites that contain on-page elements indicating they're using Hotjar:

#### 1. Table Reference
The Table reference lists all the tables you can query. Expand each table to see it's structure. You can shape the response of your query to include only the necessary information. This is handy when you're trying to use as few [credits](/essentials/credits) as possible.

#### 2. Query Editor
This is where you write your query in SQL. Can't write SQL? No problem, reach out to us and we'll help you.

#### 3. Results Section
After an execution is finished, this is where the results are listed for your most recent query.

#### 4. Executions Tab
After every execution is complete, it's saved and available for export in the Executions tab. This is convenient if you want to iterate on a query multiple times to get different results or want to revisit your query history.

---

### Additional functionality
Export the result of your current query by clicking "Export". Keep in mind you must wait for the execution to finish in order to export. 
You can additionally export any previously executed queries in the Executions tab.

#### Schedule your query

/>

Scheduling allows you to automatically re-run your query at a given interval. Only the changes in your query will cost [credits](/essentials/credits).

Sign up for notifications in order to be notified of changes to your results as they're detected. This is often valuable for people who want to monitor when a new website/company drifts into your search criteria. This means that website has added or removed a given software, the ideal moment for you or your sales team to reach out to them! 

Want to receive your notifications directly in Slack? You must first connect slack in your [Integrations Section](https://app.markix.com/settings/integrations) before scheduling.
