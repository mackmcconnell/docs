### API Reference
For API documentation please see our [API reference](https://docs.markix.com/api-reference/introduction).

### Markix Web Interface
The Markix user interface has three important sectiosn:
1. **Table Reference**
2. **Query Editor**
3. **Results Section**
4. **Executions Tab**

In this screenshot we’re simply searching the entire web to return all websites that contain on-page elements indicating they're using Hotjar:

/>

#### 1. Table Reference

Table reference lists all the tables you can query. Click into each table to see its structure. You can shape the response of your query to include only the necessary information. This is handy when you're trying to use as few credits as possible.

#### 2. Query Editor
This is where you write your query in SQL. Can't write SQL? No problem, reach out to us and we'll help you.

#### 3. Results Section
This is where the results are listed for your current query.

#### 4. Executions Tab
After every execution is complete, it's saved saved and available for export in the Executions tab. This is convenient if you want to iterate upon your queries many times to get different results and may want to revisit your query history.

---

### Additional functionality
Export any live query by clicking "Export". You can additionally export any previously executed queries in the Executions tab.

#### Make updates to your query and re-run:
Once you’ve run your query you can make iterations and continue to re-run. All prior results will be saved in the Executions tab (#4 in prior screenshot).

#### Schedule your query
Scheudling allows you to re-run your query at a given interval. Only the changes in your query will cost credits.

Sign up for notifications in order to be notified of changes to your results as they're detected. This is often valuable for people who want to monitor when a new website/company drifts into your search criteria. 

This means that website has added or removed a given software, an exciting time for a sales person working with a complementary or competing software to reach out to them! 

Want to receive your notifications directly in Slack? You must first connect slack in your [Integrations section](https://app.markix.com/settings/integrations) before scheduling.
