Your usage of Markix relies on a credit system. This guide will explain how credits work, how they're consumed and managed.

​
## What are Credits?
Credit's are Markix's platform currency, allowing executions and data access via the API. In short, larger queries consume more credits.

Every month your credits will replenished, according to your plan. Unused credits do not carry forward into future months.

For teams using Markix, credits are shared among an entire team, not per-user.

​
## What Consumes Credits?
- Executing queries
Scheduling queries
Materializing query results
Data exports via API
Inserting data into tables
Opting for larger, more powerful engines will result in higher credit consumption.
​
Managing Your Credits
To view your current credit usage, hover over the odometer icon at the top of your dashboard. Ensure you’re checking within the correct context.

For a detailed view of credit usage and other quotas, navigate to Settings → Subscriptions.

If you need additional credits beyond your plan’s allocation, utilize the “pay-as-I-go” feature. Adjust the “Limit extra credits” field to set a maximum dollar amount for additional credit purchases. By default, this limit is set to $0.


## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```
