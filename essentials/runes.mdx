`Runes` are pre-built datasets you can use in your queries, making writing your queries a little easier.

For example, pretend you want to query for all companies using [Postscript](https://postscript.io/), but only the ones on [Shopify](https://shopify.com/). You can simply query the Shopify rune like so:

```SQL Example_query.sql
SELECT distinct domain
FROM http_responses
WHERE lower(body) LIKE '%src="https://static.hotjar.com/%'
OR lower(body) LIKE '%src="https://script.hotjar.com/%';
```

Our team has built hundreds of Runes and we're adding new ones every week.
Something you want to see Rune-ified? Simply tell us and we'll prioritize it.
