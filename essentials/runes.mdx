`Runes` are pre-built datasets you can use in your queries, making writing your queries a little easier.

For example, imagine you want to query for all companies using Hotjar, but only the ones also on Shopify. You can simply query the Shopify rune like so:

```SQL Example_query.sql
SELECT DISTINCT domain
FROM http_responses
WHERE domain IN (SELECT domain FROM rune_shopify) 
AND (LOWER(body) LIKE '%/static.hotjar.com/%'
    OR LOWER(body) LIKE '%src="/script.hotjar.com/%'); 
```

Our team has built hundreds of Runes and we're adding new ones every week.
Something you want to see Rune-ified? Simply tell us and we'll prioritize it.
