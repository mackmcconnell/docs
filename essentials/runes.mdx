`Runes` are pre-built datasets you can use in your queries, making writing your queries a little easier.

For example, pretend you want to query all HubSpot users on the web for some specific information (_which of them use Hubspot chat?_). You can simply query the Rune and get on with your query!


Our team has built hundreds of Runes and we're adding new ones every week.
Something you want to see Rune-ified? Simply tell us and we'll prioritize it.
